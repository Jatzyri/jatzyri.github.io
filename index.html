          <p>
                I will be an upcoming freshman at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While studying at UNC, I plan to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Neuroscience and a minor in Computer Science. Since I will be on a pre-med track, I hope to gain experience in internships that are closely related to the medical field. I am also looking to work alongside a professor to conduct neuroscience research. 
                As a Golden Door scholar, I was given the opportunity to work as a Tech. fellow where I'm learning how to code using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have also been developing professional skills that I will be implementing, not only in my academic endeavors but in my professional future too. 
          </p>

          <p class="goal">
              I dream of becoming a neurosurgeon. My dream is grounded in my family’s experiences with mental illness and the healthcare system. This drives me to learn more about how the brain works and understand the experiences of those affected by mental illness. I am also passionate about helping others through community service. I've had experiences that have inspired me to one day become a surgeon who can offer pro-bono surgeries to support families who might otherwise not be able to receive treatment.
              
              As a woman of color, immigrant, and public-school student, I know first-hand the challenges and barriers that families and students face both in school and life. I dream of a more equitable world, so I actively work to reduce the opportunity gap for students of color in my school district. 
              
              I'm aware of the challenges that i'll face on my own journey to becoming a surgeon, including the reality that there are very limited scholarships for medical students and even fewer for DACA students. I plan to graduate college and medical school using the same ambition and desire to learn that guided me in high school. I believe my success in the medical field will allow me to serve as a role model for other students and change the false narratives that exist around DACA students and students of color.
